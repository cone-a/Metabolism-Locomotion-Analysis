# Metabolism-Locomotion-Analysis
Metabolism Locomotion Analysis using ARIMA model

Input the locomotion file into script and run the analysis. There is a circadian rhythm in this trace because this is from a lab animal. Mice have more locomotion at night because that is when they are awake, and move less during the day because they are sleeping. Mice sleep during the day to avoid prey and scavenge/ hunt at night. The ARIMA model predicts the circadian rhythm of mice locomotion. Additionally, this analysis included other statistical methods that might be of interest.
